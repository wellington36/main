; Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater
; than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.  Write a predicate to find
; the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.

    (define (goldbach-iter lst-1 lst-2)

            ((= (+ (car lst-1) (car lst-2)) number) (list (car lst-1) (car lst-2)))
            (else (goldbach-iter lst-1 (cdr lst-2)))))
