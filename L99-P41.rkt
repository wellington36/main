; Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, print a list
; of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition.

;Example:
;(goldbach-list 9 20)
; 10 = 3 + 7
; 12 = 5 + 7
; 14 = 3 + 11
; 16 = 3 + 13
; 18 = 5 + 13
; 20 = 3 + 17

; In most cases, if an even number is written as the sum of two prime
; numbers, one of them is very small.  Very rarely, the primes are
; both bigger than say 50. Try to find out how many such cases there
; are in the range 2..3000.

;Example (for a print limit of 50):
;(goldbach-list 1 2000 50)
;992 = 73 + 919
;1382 = 61 + 1321
;1856 = 67 + 1789
;1928 = 61 + 1867
